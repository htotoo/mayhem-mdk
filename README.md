## How to get the hardware
All the design files are in the pcb folder. They are set up so you can let [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) manufacture a few boards by using the files in pcb/production.


## How to compile
The software consists of two separate parts:
- The Standalone App that is uploaded and executed on the portapack.
  - This will be embedded in the the ESP32 firmware, so is required first.
  - The guide can be found [here](src/uart/Readme.md)
- The firmware for the ESP32-S3.
  - The guide can be found [here](src/portapack-external-module/README.md) 
  - Note: ESP-IDF version 5.4 introduced a breaking change in the I2C subsystem. So use the latest version of 5.3.

## How to use the example UART app
Once the Firmware is uploaded and the module is plugged into the Portapack, the UART app should appear in the Utilities menu.

The UART app will display any UART signal on pin 14.
